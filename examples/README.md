# Oracle Examples

Three focused examples that demonstrate Oracle's key features and Perchance syntax.

## What's Included

### `encounters.md` - Basic Interactive Subtables

Simple two-part subtables showing `[creature]` + `[location]` combinations. Perfect for learning how interactive results work.

### `treasures.md` - Complex Nested Subtables

Multiple `[treasure]` references that can resolve to different subtables like `[coins]`, `[gems]`, or `[items]`. Shows how the same reference can produce different results.

### `subfolder/spells.md` - Advanced Nested Variables

Highly complex table with many layers of nested subtables. Demonstrates the full power of Perchance syntax with multiple variables in a single result.

## How to Use

1. Load this `examples` folder as your vault in Oracle
2. Search for tables or browse the list
3. Click on any table to roll
4. **Try the interactive features**: Click on bracketed text like `[creature]` or `[treasure]` in the results to reroll just that part!

## Learning Progression

- **Start with Forest Encounters**: Learn basic `[creature]` and `[location]` interactions
- **Try Treasure Hoard**: See how multiple `[treasure]` references work
- **Explore Wild Magic**: Experience complex nested variables like `[feature]` that lasts `[duration]`

Each example builds on the previous one, from simple two-part combinations to complex multi-layered systems.
