# Forest Encounters

Examples showcasing Oracle's table features, from simple to complex.

## Weather

The simplest possible table - just multiple entries in the output section.

```perchance
title
  Weather

output
  Sunny and warm
  Cloudy with light breeze
  Rainy and cool
  Foggy and mysterious
  Stormy with heavy winds
  Clear and cold
```

**Try this**: This is the most basic table format. Each roll picks one random entry from the output section.
